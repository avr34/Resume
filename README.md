## Experience

#### ***SWE Intern*** - [*Mathnasium*](https://www.mathnasium.com/math-centers/chatham) - *March 2025 - August 2025*

- Spearheaded a project developing a full-stack Javascript/Node.js application that generates emails for parents of students at a Math Tutoring Center I work for.
- Effectively employs a BNF Grammar, that is used to generate syntactically valid text.
- Was working on a Node.js backend that’ll retrieve student information, further reducing required user input
- Currently being used to send 110-150 emails per day, saving 5 centers 30-40 hours a week.

## Projects

#### ***Sound Based Triangulation*** - *July 2025 - Present*

- Currently working on a short distance sound based triangulation system.
- Designed a custom PCB using KiCAD to amplify, filter, and sample incoming signals.
- Signal Processing will be performed on an ESP32 S3 MCU.

#### ***NeuralNet*** - [(*Github*)](https://github.com/avr34/NeuralNet) - *Oct 2024 - Feb 2025*

- Fully-Connected Neural Network Library for Regression and Classification in C.
- A pet project to learn Machine Learning algorithms (minimal external libraries used).
- Currently uses ReLU activation, more to be added soon.
- Backpropagation using Stochastic Gradient Descent in Matrix form.


#### ***Collision Avoidance System for Cars*** - *Sept 2023 - Jan 2024*

- Accelerometer based system that detects hard braking and alerts surrounding drivers accordingly using hazard lights.
- Utilized an Arduino Nano Microcontroller board to handle IO.
- Presented in NJIT’s First Year Design showcase.
