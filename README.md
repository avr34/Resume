## Experience

#### ***Internship*** - [*Mathnasium*](https://www.mathnasium.com/math-centers/chatham) - *March 2025 - Present*

- Spearheaded a project developing a full-stack Javascript/Node.js application that generates emails for parents of students at a Math Tutoring Center I work for.
- Effectively employs a BNF Grammar, that is used to generate syntactically valid text.
- Working on a Node.js backend that’ll retrieve student information, further reducing required user input
- Currently in the process of being deployed
- Testing has shown it'll save *37.5 hours* across 5 centers.

- Backpropagation using Stochastic Gradient Descent in Matrix form.


#### ***Collision Avoidance System for Cars*** - *Sept 2023 - Jan 2024*

- Accelerometer based system that detects hard braking and alerts surrounding drivers accordingly using hazard lights.
- Utilized an Arduino Nano Microcontroller board to handle IO.
- Presented in NJIT’s First Year Design showcase.


#### ***CRT Oscilloscope Repair*** - *Nov 2024 - Feb 2025*

- Bought and rebuilt a BK Precision Model 1461, Single Channel Oscilloscope from Craigslist.
- Came with several blown capacitors and one shorted resistor affecting the beam's sweep speed.
